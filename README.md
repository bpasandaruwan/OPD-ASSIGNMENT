The Hospital-OPD Management System we developed is a desktop application system that was built using the technologies which are C# & MySqlServer. By analyzing the project requirements, we categorized our system into seven main functions which also include their sub functions as well. Therefore, the seven main functions are Patient management, Postal management, Complain management, Appointment management, Reference management, User management, and Report management. Since we have analyzed and recognized well our project’s main requirements, and with our group members’ efforts, we were able to build a successful Hospital management System with additional features that we were able to do project satisfaction level.
